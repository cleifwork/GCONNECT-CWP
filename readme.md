**GConnect Custom WiFi Portal (GCONNECT-CWP)** is a custom captive portal designed for Omada controllers, providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for WiFi access. This portal is tailored to enhance the user experience with a visually appealing design and straightforward functionality.

## Interface Description
The GCONNECT-CWP interface features a clean and modern design with a blue color scheme that is both inviting and easy on the eyes. The interface is divided into several sections, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Header Section:**
    - The top section displays the title "GConnect Feeds" in bold white text.
    - Below the title, there is a prompt to "Check our wifi rates!" encouraging users to explore more about the service.
    - A "SEE MORE" button is prominently displayed, inviting users to click for additional information.

2. **Main Section:**
    - The main section features the GConnect logo, which includes the text "GConnect" with a stylized WiFi symbol integrated into the design.
    - A greeting message, such as "Good evening!" is displayed below the logo. This greeting automatically changes based on the time of day, providing a personalized touch.

3. **Voucher Code Section:**
    - This section is designed for users to enter their voucher codes to access the WiFi service.
    - The heading "Stream, Play & Enjoy" emphasizes the high-speed capabilities of the service, with a rotating text that also includes other messages like "Up to 50Mbps download/upload speed!" and more.
    - A text box labeled "Enter voucher code" is provided for users to input their codes.
    - A large, circular button with the number "8" is positioned next to the text box. This number indicates the number of characters left or the length of the voucher code.
    - A "GCONNECT" button is prominently displayed at the bottom, allowing users to submit their voucher codes and gain access to the WiFi service.

4. **Wi-Fi Rates Page (See More):**
    - When users click the "SEE MORE" button, they are directed to a page displaying a detailed table of Wi-Fi rates provided by GCONNECT WIFI.
    - The table lists different pricing options, the corresponding time duration for each price, and the number of users allowed for each option. The prices are listed in Philippine Pesos (â‚±).
